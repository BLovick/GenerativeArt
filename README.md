Generative Art Dailies
----------------------

I've decided that the best way to learn Generative Art is to do daily sketches - and since I want to give back a little of what I'm learning, I'm releasing them here.

You can find screenshots, videos and executables for Windows at the weekly roundups at my blog:

If you want to load the sketches yourself and be able to modify them, you will need [Processing](https://processing.org).

Most sketches you can just open and run. If it complains about missing libraries, you can add them in the menu under: Sketch->Import Library->Add Library. Libraries I've used:
 * Ani
 * ControlP5
 
*A note of caution: This source code is neither clean nor optimized nor documented. I've experimented a lot and often didn't clean up afterwards - doing a sketch daily is already a pretty big time commitment. Treat it as you would treat game jam/hackathon code.*
